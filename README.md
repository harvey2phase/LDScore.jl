## To Do
- `ld_score_regression` is not complete
- `estimate_h2`
	- Only has one test case
	- Lots of error checks missing
- Build struct `Gencov` the same way `Hsq` is built to reuse abstract type `LD_Score_Regression` functions

## Estimating SNP-hertiability from summary statistics
To estimate SNP-heritability, we need three sources of data:
1. Summary statistics from a GWAS.
2. List of SNPs.
3. LD scores for each SNP.

LD scores for European and Asian populations can be directly downloaded from the [original LDSC website](https://github.com/bulik/ldsc).

## LD Score Regression
LD Score regression quantifies contribution of polygenic signals and confounding biases in the inflation of the distribution of test statistic in genome-wide association studies (1); it does this by examinig the relationship between test statistics and linkage disequilibrium
